Blockchain - peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network

Smart contracts allow for aggrements without centralized intermediaries.

It is a self executing set of instructions that is executed without a third party intermidiary 

Smart Contracts, are written in code and automatically executed by the descentralized blockchain network


BTC is an asset but Eth is an asset and utility

Blockchain has the oracle problem. Blockchains are deterministic systems.
They are walled, nothing outside can work inside. Oracles are devices that bring data into the blockchain - 
for them to stay decentralized they.

Chainlink is a decentralized modular oracle network that allows you to ring data into your smart contracts. These are 
hybrid smart contracts that can have this on-chain settlement and interact with the real world.
This allows us to customiuze our smart contracts in anyway we wantt as we can bring in external data ands delevate them to do anything we want.

Hybrid smart contracts - refer to this. This is specifically a smart contract with aan off chain component

Chainlink is a smart contract platform agnostic, meaning it will work on ethereum, avalanche, polygon, polkadot or any blockchain with a smartcontract platform out there
